One thing I have always found to be interesting about computer science is how much it evolves over time. As a study rooted in everchanging technology, the way coding is done now compared to 50 years ago is vastly different. With drastically advancing technology at our fingertips, the possibilities of what can be accomplished using computer science drastically expand as well. Not only do possibilities change with the times, but also the procedures and expectations that come along with coding and their standards. In the way that coding used to be done in a very cramped style to optimize memory and storage, coding has now evolved with the advancement of the computers we use to prioritize style over memory and storage efficiency. 

## Having Standards
My first introduction to coding standards appeared in my Program Structure class, where we were given an example of what is and is not acceptable styles of coding that we would have to implement. We were informed that if we did not follow these expectations, our grades for each assignment would decrease drastically. I recall being severely annoyed by this new expectation since I felt this took more time away from us working on our projects and improving their logic, and rather made us focus our attention on miniscule aspects of coding that didn’t have any impact on user experience. While this was my initial impression, I soon begun getting into the habit of coding with this specific coding style and it became second nature to me. As time went on, I realized how much taking the few extra seconds to add an extra space or start a new line impacted my experience coding. As we begun to develop more advanced projects with more files, methods, and functions, all of which found a way to interact with each other, the coding standard made it easier for me to follow the logic of my code and understand what was happening. What I had once perceived as a waste of time and distracting from the logic, soon became the sole reason I was able to read through my own logic so quickly to work on further development. 

While I learned a lot from that class, one of the main takeaways was my professor saying is that in the end, even if your code doesn’t work, so long as it looks nice and follows the coding standard, there is a chance you will still be able to land the job you’re shooting for. At the time he said this the entire class laughed because it sounded silly and improbable. Broken code being good enough so long as it’s typed nicely? Sounds fictitious. However, he continued to explain his thought process. If you have a code that works but is coded with no coding standard, thus being very hard to read, compared to a code that doesn’t work but looks very neat in the way it was written, an employer may gravitate towards the one that looks nicer. There’s a chance they won’t run your program to see if it works and check the logic, but they will look to see what you can code. If in the few moments of scanning your source code, all they see is a mess then that tells them that this person’s code would not do well in a group setting. 

## Teamwork Makes the Dream Work
Despite often being depicted as the career of a loner in popular forms of media, coding is very collaborative in nature. While going through undergrad, most coding class you take end up being completed alone since the point of the assignments is to hone your individual skillset. However, in real life you often must collaborate on large projects as a team, because the scale of what a company may want you to complete is too large for a single person to do. Thus, how you can work with others is a large factor of what makes you appealing or not to employers. Coding standards are a quick and easy way for companies to analyze that. If you can produce neat and readable code, it makes the lives of your current team members and future employees who will need to reference and understand your code a lot easier. It demonstrates consideration and awareness towards others on how the work you produce must interact with them. It is easy to brush past coding standards when you are working on a project alone that only has a few files to read through, because even if it takes a little more time, the logic of the code can be reasoned out due to it being fairly small. However, once you begin to work with others on projects that have hundreds of files and thousands of lines of code, proper indentation suddenly makes a world of a difference.

Overall, I understand the negative initial response many computer scientists have upon their first introduction to coding standards. After all, I used to feel the same. However, one you realize that coding is a collective effort which requires collaboration on all ends to achieve a final goal, you will come to realize the necessity of applying proper coding standards in the way you program. The earlier you start a habit, the more refined it will become, and the earlier you begin to apply coding standards to your programs, the more refined they will become.
