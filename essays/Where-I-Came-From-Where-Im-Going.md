	For many people around the world, the years 2020 through 2022 are remembered as the infamous years of the COVID-19 lockdown and pandemic. The world was drawn to an abrupt halt as the illness spread in ways no one had ever imagined. It was undoubtedly a time of hardship and solitude for many, my family and I included. Despite the turmoil faced, it allowed for a time of reflection and growth for many in unexpected ways. Prior to 2020, I was never sure what I wanted to study when I went off to college. However, the lockdown, and specifically having to switch from in-person to online school for a large portion of my high school experience, gave me an unprecedented clarity of what I wanted to do with my life. With the sudden increase of technology use in the classroom (e.g., Zoom classes and online assignments), and using technology in my free time to unwind, I became increasingly curious about the inner workings of the technology I had become so familiar with in my day to day life.
  In my junior year of high school, I was fortunate enough to intern with Marion  Ano, owner and developer of Wahine Coder, an Oahu-based company that specializes in mobile and web development. This was my first exposure to the creativity of STEM fields. Prior to this, I had never liked any of my science and math classes because I felt I was never smart enough and couldn’t imagine myself studying a STEM discipline. However, seeing the creative process of designing and implementing a website that one imagined showed me that there was more to STEM than I initially believed. One of the most memorable moments of that internship was when I sat in on a clientele meeting and Marion presented the new updates she added to the customer’s website. I recall the client being overjoyed from seeing her vision come to life thanks to Marion, and that was a moment where it clicked for me that technology can bring creative visions to life. From that point on, I decided I wanted to pursue computer science so I could also learn how to create like Marion.
  In my senior year of high school, I then enrolled in my school's AP Computer Science class. This was my first true hands-on experience with coding and the problem solving that came with it. I soon started to enjoy the analytical side of coding that I had always written off with other STEM disciplines. Nothing beat the feeling of being faced with a problem that seemed impossible, only to finally solve it and feel proud of yourself for finding a solution. My teacher, Mr. Toyofuku, found out I was planning to go to the University of Hawaii at Manoa for college and suggested I investigate data science due to the resources the University had to offer. After taking my first data science-based class, Intro to Machine Learning, I was introduced to a new side of computer science I had not yet known. The task of interpreting data and using different models to figure out what story you wanted to tell your audience became instantly appealing to me.
  Now, as a junior in college studying computer science and data science, I am fortunate enough to be working as an Indigenous Data Hub assistant based out of the Create(X) Lab, where I get to apply my interests of data science, data visualization, and interactive media, to work on local and Hawaiian based tech projects for the community. I am fortunate enough to now be in the position where I can assist in bringing other’s visions to life with technology, push myself to learn how new technologies work, and practice my analytical skills when working on implementation. I hope to keep developing my skills in data science, data visualization, and product design to one day be a mentor to the next generation as those were to me. Had it not been for Marion, Mr. Toyofuku, and my current mentors, Kari Noe and Kamuela Enos, I would not be the computer scientist I am today. I understand the importance of mentorship when it comes to building up a person and their career path, thus I hope to one day return what has been given to me for the next generation of coders.
