My project, Detecting Patterns and Trends of Influenza A in the USA, was developed under the mentorship of the CyberInfrastructure TRaining for Undergraduates in Summer (CITRUS) program at the University of Hawaii. It allowed me a research opportunity in a REU-style immersion to develop skills in CyberInfrastructure with a climate-based research project. 

My topic focused on the interminglings of health and climate which lead me towards wanting to apply data science techniques to identify patterns and trends of Influenza A in the USA. The research question I based my findings around was, "Are there any consistent patterns in the timing and intensity of influenza A seasons?". To which I then cleaned, graphed, and applied various statistical tests (such as chi-squared and Kruskal-Wallis) to answer this question.
